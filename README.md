# Water Polo Player Tracking & Covid-19 Analysis

This repository contains a C++ application that utilizes computer vision techniques to track water polo players' movements and analyze their proximity to assess potential Covid-19 transmission risks. The project was used to generate data for the [Water Polo Covid-19 Analysis](https://cjkreienkamp.github.io/water-polo-covid-19-analysis). 
The analysis was used to provide insight and data for the published paper [Transmission risk of COVID-19 in high school and college water polo](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35546389/).

## Project Overview

The project involves:  

- **Player Tracking**: Manual input guided by computer vision to record player positions.  
- **Data Interpolation**: Estimating player positions between frames for smoother movement tracking.  
- **Proximity Analysis**: Evaluating how often and how closely players interact to assess Covid-19 risk factors.  

This tool was designed to help researchers and sports analysts understand movement patterns in team sports and their implications for viral transmission.  

## Features

- üèä **Player Localization**: Track players' x-y positions manually with visual assistance.  
- üìà **Data Analysis**: Generate reports on player proximity during gameplay.  
- üé• **Video Processing**: Use OpenCV to analyze video footage frame by frame.  
- üèü **Pool Area Definition**: Define the pool boundaries for accurate spatial tracking.  
- ‚öô **Automated Interpolation**: Fill in missing position data between user-defined frames.
